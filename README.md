# Home Tutorly React Assessment Submission

Hello! 👋

This is my submission for the **Home Tutorly** React assessment. The project is built using **Vite**, which I chose because of its speed and performance as a modern build tool and bundler. It's a great fit for fast iterations in development.

## Getting Started 🚀

Follow the steps below to run the project on your local machine:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository to your local machine using the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amavictor/home-tutor-react.git
````

### Step 2: Open in VS Code

Navigate to the project directory and open it in VS Code:

```bash
cd <project-directory>
code .
````

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Yarn installed. If you don’t, you can install it by running:

```bash
npm install --global yarn

````
Make sure you have Yarn installed. If you don’t, you can install it by running:

```bash
yarn install

````

### Step 4: Start the Development Server

Now that everything is set up, start the development server with:

```bash
yarn run dev
````

This will spin up the development server, and you can view the app by opening your browser and navigating to:

```bash
http://localhost:5173/
````
That’s it! 🎉 You’re now ready to explore the project.

### Why Vite? ⚡️

I opted to use Vite as the bundler for this project because of its blazing-fast hot module replacement (HMR), optimized build speed, and overall efficiency in the development process. Vite leverages ESM (ES Modules) in the browser, making it much faster than traditional bundlers like Webpack.

Thank you for reviewing my submission. 🙏
